# IntelliJ plugin for Scheme language

This plugin is modified from [cmf/schemely](https://github.com/cmf/schemely) which code is somehow too old to compiled on newer IntelliJ platforms.  
I made the old code can be compiled on newer IntelliJ platforms, and modified some code of the Lexer and Parser, and also with other modifcations (Some commits in [Saigut/schemely](https://github.com/Saigut/schemely)).  
But this plugin is not well tested yet, and also have some issues that may be hard to be fixed for me. And I have little free time to work on this plugin recently.
